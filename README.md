# Tanita Chart
This is a simple grapher (based on [d3.js](http://d3js.org/)) for raw CSV data from Tanita weighing scales and body composition monitors.
Only the **BC-601** model is supported.

This is a simple web page purely client-side, with javascript parsing and rendering, which means no data are sent to server.

# Demo
You can try it here (with your own data).

- body part mouseover
- zooming support
